## What is xScratch?
Right now we plan xscratch to be a scratch project file sharing community with simple profiles, commenting and an offline editor based on Scratch 2 and 3 (Made as a direct response to LLK's Scratch 3.0). We plan for it to be for ages 13+ with fewer restrictions.

#### Awesome? How can I help
Anyone can help by reviewing the code on the repo and reporting us of any bugs you find. Once its online we hope to get as many scratchers on the new platform as possible :)

#### How do I run an instance of xScratch on my local machine
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thexscratchproject/www-xscratch.git
cd www-xscratch
npm i
npm start
```

##### Thanks for stopping by. :)
